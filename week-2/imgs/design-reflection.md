What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

1. Information gathering: What is the sites purpose?
2. Planning: What does the user need to be able to do on the site?
3. Design: How do you want the site to look? Who is your audience?
4. Development: The part where we do our coding magic.
5. Test/Delivery: Is the site and all its pathways working properly? Do you/you're client find it easy to navigate?
6. Maintenance: What type of updates need to me made? Do you have new content to add? Does your client have new employees to add?

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal will be to show a resume of my previous work/life experience along with projects I've created. I'd like to create others with other purposes, but for now lets just stick with me using it for career related purposes.


What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience would be employers. My site will address them because I want to show the different type of work experiences I've had in the past and how I might be able to relate that to their needs.


What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

This is why I want to add some life experience to my site. I've dipped into a lot of different fields, so I can relate to say maybe what a film maker might want, what a dance/art studio might want, even a politician, although I'd prefer to stay out of that last one. If I have some of these terms on my site, they will be found doing a search.

I'd like users to see my portfolio, examples of work I've done in the past in different fields. I am not much into blogging, but hey maybe some people really love reading blogs about nuts who attend dev bootcamp.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience? 

The main thing we are looking for here is ease for the user, we don't want the user experience to be frusrating or stressful. These two need to coincide, the design could be really cool, but it's no fun if its a pain to navigate. It is also good to note that it is not one size fits all, it should be tailored to the audience.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?  

User experience design is how the user feels when interacting with a site. It is valuable to know because you want to create a site that is most easily navigated by the target audience. If your users are having difficulty, this should inspire you to see how you can improve the site for their needs. We don't want our users pulling out their hair!

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Actually I think that part is coming up right now. Is the screen shot I took going to make it to my imgs directory? What exactly is markdown and was I suppose to use it here? Let's see how many attempts this takes.
