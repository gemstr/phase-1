<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It's really cool to see how it comes to life. I learned that I have a lot more learning to do with html. I feel like everyone knows how to create a site but me. I wish I had more to bring to the table on this topic. I have watched tutorial videos and played around with it on Codeacademy. I need to give myself a serious crash course so I don't feel like such a loser.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

My pairing partner had more to tell me about this then I knew. He has had experience with html and he discussed with me a few of the changes that he was aware of. For example, html 5 won't be using div's as much/or at all. I suppose this could be the one and only positive thing for me about this, as I am not accustomed to previous versions, so I'll learn the newest version fresh.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Honestly, I don't have an answer for this one right now, I feel like since I am so new to this, I don't have previous practices to refer to. Although I did try to follow the guidelines for keeping everything tidy. At first I wasn't even sure how the different indents would affect the page.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

I feel like the downside is what I mentioned earlier about updates. While this doesn't apply to me, those that are accustomed to a certain way, may be a little annoyed having to adapt yet again. What's good about it? Well I learned it is literally THE ONLY markup language, so I suppose without it we wouldn't be surviving here. And perhaps those updates are to make it easier or more specific for developers.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I will tell you when I get there! So far all I have gotten is the basic structure. What I have been doing is creating opening and closing tags first and then filling what little I know inside of them.
