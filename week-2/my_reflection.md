What is your site's primary goal or purpose?

My site's primary goal will be to show a resume of my previous work/life experience along with projects I've created/

What kind of content will your site feature?

It will feature a photo, a brief bio, contact informaion, a blog link, projects I've worked on, and I'd also like to have links to a few films that I have made. 

What is the best way to share that content with users?

The best way to share content is to attempt to create a site that is user friendly, but also promotes the user experience. I would want to make it very straight forward to eliminate any frustrations for the users.

Think about your target audience. What are gheir interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My site's primary audience will be to those who seek to employ me! I have a very creative side, so I think I would do very well with someone who would know how they wanted their sites to look and feel, and hopefully I would be able to execute that for them.

How do you think most users will find your site?

This is why I want to add some life experience to my site. I've dipped into a lot of different fields, so I can relate to say maybe what a film maker might want, what a dance/art studio might want, even a politician, although I'd prefer to stay out of that last one. If I have some of these terms on my site, they will be found doing a search.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I'd like users to see my portfolio, examples of work I've done in the past in different fields. I'm even thinking of doing an interests section that might be fun where I can relate to others on a myriad of topics. I am not much into blogging, but hey maybe some people really love reading blogs about nuts who attend dev bootcamp, so that will be there as well.
