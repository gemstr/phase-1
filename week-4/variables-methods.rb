#locations that hold data.

#What was confusing about this material? What made sense?

#I had a little trouble with 4.3.2, the nums. I really have to get used to the proper
#syntax, I got a little quote and paranthesis happy and I must have tried that RSpec 
#100 times only to learn I didn't need any of that at all. What made the most sense to me
#was the simple strings, and simple math, pretty straighforward for me as of now, probably
#not tomorrow.
