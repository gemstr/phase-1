Positioning Reflection

How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

You can right click on a document and select "Inspect element". From here you can hover over different areas of a page to see how it is stylized. Here you can look at the code, the positioning, and the style elements.


How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can resize elements by changing the width and the height. I believe you can do this with pixels or percentages.


What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?


Fixed- These elements are independent from everything else on a page. Fixed elements are positioned based on the browser window. Which leads me to question, does this affect anything if it is viewed on a tablet or a mobile version?

Static- The default positioning. When elements aren't assigned a position they default to static and will appear in the order they come in in the code.

Relative- These positions need an assignment for top, bottom, left, and right. If we have a static element, we want to be sure to place the relative in a manner so the two won't overlap.

Absolute- I don't fully understand this one myself yet. So the following is a brief description of my research from the web... The position of an absolute element is determined by its parent elements. If all of the parent elements are either static, or there are none, then the element is positioned based on the body. 

As of now I find them all hard to use since I just learned what they were two days ago.

What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

The padding is the space between the main content and the border. Margin is the space outside the border. Think of it as those little russian dolls...

Mini doll = content
Medium doll = padding
Large doll = border
XL doll = margin

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I think I will learn to love it because I like to get creative with things. Although its been very difficult for me since I have zero experience with html/css. I wish this was the Matrix and I could just upload a crash course of it into my brain.
