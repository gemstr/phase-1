	<h1> Why use Version Control Anyway?</h1>


	<body>


<p>First of all forgive me for making this a very short blog. I am just trying to make this thing come to life. 

What are the benefits of version control? 

Version control is beneficial because it keeps track of all the changes we are going to be making to our codes. If we make a mistake, we can always go back to a version we started with and start over. 

How does git help you keep track of changes? 

Git saves the contents of the files in your project. It can reproduce the contents of the files exactly how you originally saved them. Any changes you or others make will be seen on Github. 

Why use Github to store your code? 

Why not? Honestly I don't know much about any other ways to store my code right now, I'd have to do some google investigating. As for now Github is all I know. I suppose we want to store our work there because we have an MIT license are able to easily navigate and see eachother's changes and comments.

<!--Below is what a snippet looks like -->

	<content><![CDATA[Type your snippet here]]></content>
    <!-- Optional: Tab trigger to activate the snippet -->
    <tabTrigger>xyzzy</tabTrigger>
    <!-- Optional: Scope the tab trigger will be active in -->
    <scope>source.python</scope>
    <!-- Optional: Description to show in the menu -->

<!-- Reflection
 

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

In this challenge we used snippets in sublime. Snippets allow us to insert a code or a piece of text to be used over and over. This will save us a lot of typing time.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out on a page through the use of tags. The following is the order...
<html>
<head>
  Title within the head.
<body>
  Within the body could be several elements such as the <main>, <article>,<section>, <nav>, and <aside>. H's and p tags are used throughout as well.
<footer>  

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned that sublime is more expansive then I thought it was. I think the use of snippets will be great to save time. I am sure I will be creating more at a later date, as of now I don't know how to execute them. Not quite understanding the final question, research shortcuts that already exist in sublime or html? I am very new to html, so I just have to do what I know with the basics, I am sure as I move along, I'll understand more shortcuts. I've already learned a few from my corhort mates! -->
