1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I touched on all of the videos and articles listed. As far as meditation goes, it's one of those things that I want to make work for me but I just can't seems to. I am one of those people who tries to go to bed at night and I just can't stop my mind from running. My thoughts coule be about anything, something stupid, something silly, its just all over the place. It seems that meditation would be a nice solution for this, maybe someday I'll get on board. 

Time boxing is working in an agreed allotment of time, followed by a mandatory break to reflect and regroup. The pomodoro technique is interesting to me, I've never tried anything like that. I am not a procrastinator, I am the type to dive in and push until the project is complete, so I might be annoyed when that timer goes off. I can see where this might be more beneficial in group settings to keep everyone on the same page.


Currently I feel that I manage my time well, although I know that this program is going to be very intestive and I will need to make adjustments. I also don't have a lot to juggle in my personal life, so it's pretty easy.

My current strategy works for what I have now, but like I said I know I will need to make adjustments. I am type A personality and I am very set in my routine, so it does worry me a little how I will execute these changes. I think of the material above, the best way to start for me is by creating small habits, that way they will eventually become routine for me as well. 

My overall plan for Phase-0 time management? Honestly I'll have to feel it out first to see what type of adjustments I will need to make. Since I am coming in with zero knowledge, I feel I will be on the higher end of the timeframe given. I really want to stay on top of the challenges and keep up with everyone else.


1.2 The Command Line Reflection

The shell is a program that takes your commands from the command line and gives them to the operating system to perform. 

Bash is an enhanced environment of the shell on the linux system. It is the user interface we will be working on.

The most challenging thing for me in this video was staying awake. My attention span was just not compatable with the video. It was challenging understanding why we would use some of the commands shown. I don't know why we need to find how many times a word is used in a large amount of text. I don't know yet anyway. He did a good job of explaining the purpose of each command used.

In my opinion the "pwd" command is important because it basically tells you where you are and we all need to know where we exist! I feel like "ls" is a command that will be important because it gives you a list of everything in your directory and you'll be able to see what changes were made and where.

I remember about half of these off the top of my head.


-pwd: Print working directory

-ls: Gives a long list

-mv: Moves files from one location to another

-cd: Changes the current directory you are working on.

-../ Is a directory

-touch: Creates a new empty file

-mkdir: Creates new directories

-less: Less data. Allows you to move backward in a file

-rmdir: Removes a directory

-rm: Removes a file

-help: I'm not sure, but when I tried it, it spit out all kinds of commands what look like abbreviations for some.


1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection  


Alrighty, so you want to know about creating and cloning repo's on github. First things, first. Create a github account. Did you do that? Ok great, now login. 

In your homepage you will see a green button with a little plus sign that says "New repository" Click on that to get started.

Then choose a name for your repo and type it in under "Repository name".

Choose whether you want to share this repo with the public or keep it private.

Next you're going to choose a licence. For this we want to choose an "MIT" license because they are the most flexible.

Click the green button that says "Create repository". 

Give yourself some applause, you've created a repo!

Now lets say you want to clone this repo. Ok so if you notice there is a little box on the lower right hand corner of your screen with a URL in it. Go ahead highlight that URL  and make a copy of it by either right clicking it or using "cmd c". 

Next you will move to your terminal. You're going to type in "git clone" followed by the URL you just copied. You can paste by using "cmd v". 

Its as simple as that, you've cloned your repo! It now has two homes.

To fork a repo is very easy. If you go to your repo in your github page, you will see an icon on the upper right hand corner of the screen that says "Fork". Go ahead and click on that. You will be given options as to where you might want to fork/share this repo. You can click on wherever or whoever you like. 

There you have it, you have now forked your repo!


I really didn't have any struggles setting up github, the instructions were very straight foward. Although I feel when it comes to working on projects it might get a little confusing if I have several repo's with forks and commits all over the place.
