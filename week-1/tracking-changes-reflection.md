How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?

Tracking and adding changes will make our lives easier because we will all be able to view who contributed what changes and when. Since we do commits, we can always go back to a certain phase of a code. We will be able to spot any tiny changes along the way that may have helped or harmed the code.

What is a commit?

A commit is a a way of saving your code. It is accompanied by a little message you submit with your task letting you and others know exactly what was done to that project.

What are the best practices for commit messages?

Good commit messages are those that are phrased in the present tense, not the past or future. They should be brief, only 2-3 words.

What does the HEAD^ argument mean?

HEAD is used to unstage a commit.

What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the 
other?

Only three? I feel like I just did 30!

1- Work/Make changes.
2- Add and commit in the command line.
3- Push to github and continue to pull the request from there.

Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?

git checkout -b "branch-name"
git add "file-name"
git commit -m "what you did"
git push origin master followed by the branch-name
git checkout master
git merge origin master

What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?

A pull request is a request to pull information from the command line to github. This is done by following the commands I listed above after making changes.

Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?

Pull requests are good when working with teams because everyone's updated changes can be easily viewed on github. Especially if your team is scattered throughout different parts of the world!
