 Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection 
 
Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a repository on Github is very simple. Once you have an account created, look for the plus sign in the upper right corner of your screen and select "New repository". This will bring you to a new page. Give your repository a name and select if you want share it with the public or privately. Choose the MIT License (its the easiest and most flexible to work with). Then click "Create repository" Yay! Your repo is created. To clone this repo to your computer is very simple as well. You'll notice a URL in a little box in the lower right hand side of your screen. Copy that URL. Switch to your terminal and type "git clone (paste URL here)"

Describe what open source means.

Open source is sharing the process of creating a computer program with others. Anyone is allowed to make changes.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I feel pretty good about it, although I haven't started using it yet, so that may change. To me, the idea of others assisting me to improve something is great. Can you show me an easier way? Bring it on!

Assess the importance of using licenses.

I'm assuming it depends on what type of project you're working on and who you're working with will depend on the license. There are different types of licenses, some have fewer restrictions then others. MIT is the most flexible.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Well, I noticed I've been creating blank files on github. Go me! Luckily I think I've solidified the steps of getting my files on github. I struggled with getting my work saved in the proper place in sublime, that was why they were showing up with no content. I still blame windows.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Yes, git's website is an easy and probably obvious resource. https://git-scm.com/
